# database-graphviz
A simple command line tool that can generate a Graphviz graph based on your schema relationships

## Motivation

I just needed a simple tool to dump a Graphviz graph for a database on a project I was working on. The existing doctrine
bundle for symfony didn't register as a command, and I'd rather have a tool not dependant on any other integration for this
simple task.

See the [example page](doc/example.md) for some steps to get you started.
